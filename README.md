# Netflix-customer-churn-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for a Netflix-like subscription platform.
The objective is to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription based on historical data and behavioral patterns.

#Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem in subscription-based services. Predicting churn allows companies to take proactive retention measures and reduce revenue loss.

This project:

Analyzes customer data

Identifies patterns associated with churn

Builds and evaluates machine learning models to predict churn
