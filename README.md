# Netflix-customer-churn-prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a Netflix-like subscription platform.
The goal is to identify users likely to cancel their subscription using historical and behavioral data.

📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses. Accurately predicting churn enables proactive retention strategies and helps reduce revenue loss.

This project:
Analyzes customer behavior data
Identifies key factors contributing to churn
Builds and evaluates machine learning models for churn prediction
